                <p id="about">My interest for taxidermy started at a young age. At 13, I started my journey by learning
                    how to tan small animals like rabbits. As I got older and deeper into hunting, I wanted to get birds
                    mounted to put on my wall. <br> <br>
                    Being so young at the time, I was not able to pay to have them done for me, so this is where I started
                    dabbling with bird taxidermy. I watched countless youtube videos on the subject. As you can imagine,
                    my first ones were pretty rough. My family told me they looked like Daffy duck. <br> <br>
                    When I graduated highschool I strayed away from taxidermy only to be sucked right back in a few
                    months later. This is when I knew I wanted to do this not only for a hobby but for a job. From there
                    I attended
                    Pro Mount School of taxidermy in Billings, Montana. This is where I fine tuned my bird mounting
                    skills and also learned how to mount fish and big game mammals. <br> <br>
                    After 4 months of being in Billings, my school<img src="ME.jpg" alt="This is me" id="me"
                        style="float: right; width: 50%;">ing was done and I was ready to start mounting animals
                    for people whom were not myself. My business journey began slow but picked up very fast.
                    <br> <br><u> <b>Today I aim to make every mount more realistic than the last and to make your trophy
                            last a lifetime.</u></b>
